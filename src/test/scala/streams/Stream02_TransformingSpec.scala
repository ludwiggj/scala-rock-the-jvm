  // The Stream type forms a monad on the O type parameter, which means that a flatMap method
  // is available on streams, and we can use it to concatenate operations concerning the
  // output values of the stream.

  // An essential feature of fs2 streams is that their functions take constant time, regardless
  // of the structure of the stream itself. So, concatenating two streams is a constant time
  // operation, whether the streams contain many elements or are infinite. As we will see in
  // the rest of the article, this feature concerns the internal representation, which is
  // implemented as a pull-based structure.

  // Many other streaming libraries define streams and transformation in terms of sources, pipes, and sinks.
  // A source generates the elements of a stream, then transformed through a sequence of stages or pipes,
  // and finally consumed by a sink. For example, the Akka Stream library has specific types modeling these
  // concepts.

  // In fs2, the only available type modeling the above streaming concepts is Pipe[F[_], -I, +O]. Pipe is a
  // type alias for the function Stream[F, I] => Stream[F, O]. So, a Pipe[F[_], I, O] represents nothing more
  // than a function between two streams, the first emitting elements of type I, and the second emitting
  // elements of type O.

  // Therefore we can use pipes to represent transformations on streams as a sequence of stages. The through
  // method applies a pipe to a stream. Its internal implementation is straightforward since it applies the
  // function defined by the pipe to the stream:

  // fs2 library code
  // def through[F2[x] >: F[x], O2](f: Stream[F, O] => Stream[F2, O2]): Stream[F2, O2] = f(this)

    def toConsole[T]: Pipe[IO, T, Unit] = tStream => tStream.evalMap(IO.println)

    // The justiceLeagueActors stream represents the source, whereas the fromActorToNamePipe represents a pipe,
    // and the toConsole represents the sink. We can conclude that a pipe is pretty much a map/flatMap
    // type functional operation, but the pipe concept fits nicely into the mental model of a Stream.
