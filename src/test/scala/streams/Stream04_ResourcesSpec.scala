  // We donâ€™t have to use the handleErrorWith method to manage the release of resources used by the stream.
  // Instead, the fs2 library implements the bracket pattern to manage resources.
  //
  //The bracket pattern defines two functions: The first is used to acquire a resource; The second is
  // guaranteed to be called when the resource is no longer needed.
  //
  // The fs2 library implements the bracket pattern through the bracket method:
  //
  // fs2 library code
  // def bracket[F[x] >: Pure[x], R](acquire: F[R])(release: R => F[Unit]): Stream[F, R] = ???

  // The function acquire is used to acquire a resource, and the function release is used to release
  // the resource. The resulting stream has elements of type R. Moreover, the resource is released
  // at the end, both in case of success and in case of error. Notice that both the acquire and
  // release functions returns an effect since they can throw exceptions during the acquisition or
  // release of resources.

  // Use a resource during the persistence of the stream containing the actors of the JLA.

  // First, we define a value class representing a connection to a database (DatabaseConnection)
  // We use the DatabaseConnection as the resource we want to acquire and release through
  // the bracket pattern.
